<h1>Survey</h1>
<h5>Cross-Regional Commuters' Mode Choice Travel Survey</h5>

<h5>This Survey Is Intended To Measure Cross-Regional Commuters' Mode Choice Preferences</h5>

<h4>Joint Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) Survey</h4>

<p> Dear Survey Respondent,<br /> <br /> 

You have been randomly selected to participate in a research study conducted by the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. This study aims at achieving a better understanding of cross-regional commuters' mode choice preferences (e.g., drive all-way, local transit, regional transit, park-and-ride, etc.) in response to changes in transit service attributes. <br /><br /> 

We are contacting a random sample of cross-regional commuters in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) to gather information on their personal attitudes and habits associated with daily commuting work trips.<br /><br />  

The survey is divided into three sections: <b>Section A</b> will gather information on your daily commuting work trip and current travel options; <b>Section B</b> will ask about hypothetical scenarios where travel modesâ€™ service attributes are different than the current state; and, <b>Section C</b> will collect socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.<br /> <br /> 

We kindly ask you to participate in this web survey so that your opinion is represented in our study. This survey is designed to be as short as possible and will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Please answer every question in each section in order to proceed to subsequent sections. <br /><br /> 

You may choose not to complete the survey at any time without any penalty. Keep in mind, however, that the responses submitted in previous sections are not retrievable, and therefore will still be anonymously included in final survey results.<br /> <br /> 

Please note that there is no related risk involved with your participation in this study. All the collected information will be stored securely at the University and will be processed with the utmost confidentiality and for academic purposes only. Your cooperation is highly appreciated. <br /><br /> 

Should you have any questions about the study, please feel free to e-mail us at mohamed.mahmoud@utoronto.ca. For any questions regarding your rights as a respondent in this survey, you are free to contact the office of Research Ethics, University of Toronto, McMurrich Building, 2nd floor, 12 Queen's Park Crescent West Toronto, ON M5S 1S8, Tel: (416) 946-3273, Fax: (416) 946-5763, Email: ethics.review@utoronto.ca.<br /> <br /> </p>
